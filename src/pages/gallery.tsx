		"This website was for my own personal needs - anyone can create an account, sign in, and extract the audio of a youtube video to listen to! You can also add other audio files to the one you're listening to.",
		"A great website I made for a school History project about South Korea during the Middle Ages. Great CSS and lots of animations, as well as many stock photos of Korea.",
		"Minamalist social media webapp, where people can sign up within a matter of minutes. Complete with user profiles, custom tokens, and setting features!",
		"Replit, but with a beautiful user interface. Interact with your Repls, create community pages, and enjoy a minamalist design!",
		"This is the unofficial mailing system for Replit users! One can only mail a valid user who has signed up for this platform using their Repl account.",
		"A feature-packed Discord bot made for auto moderation and fun, with economy features! You can add Cookie+ into your server today! Bot currently being self-hosted, because I don't trust Replit."
