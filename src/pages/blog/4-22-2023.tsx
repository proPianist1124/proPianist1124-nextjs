				Hey! I&apos;m proPianist1124! I&apos;m a fullstack developer with experence in Nodejs, Nextjs, React, Kaboomjs, Upstash Redis, Bootstrap, jQuery, Express, and many more! I started coding in 2021 on Replit, but stopped recently because of stupid new changes - this includes the new storage update (per repl), more expensive plans with less functionality, and repls going inactive after a few weeks (this honestly pissed me off a lot). Happy reading on the rest of my blog!
